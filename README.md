# ðŸš€ Simple Universal React app starter
To solve the classic SEO problems of the SPA (Single Page applications) we can use the Isomorphic (Universal) approach.
By prerendering the page, on the server, we allow the search engines to crawl the page.

### Works like this
1. The browser points to a route.
2. The server renders the React app for that route (waiting to fetch any async data if needed).  
   - Each route's main component can have a **static fetchData** method.  
   - This method receives the Store and is useful to fetch initial data of the page, which will be saved in the Store's state.  
   - For **all the async requests** of data that is **not crucial for first render** of the page **should go into component's lifecylce methods** like componentWillMount().  
   - *Check the About's page as an example*
3. The browser obtains the rendered page with the async data, if it was obtained in previous state and with the data already in the Redux Store's state.
4. From now on the browser page acts like a SPA with all the benefits & without jeopardising the page's SEO.  


*The server also generates a simple sitemap based on the routes of the app*
